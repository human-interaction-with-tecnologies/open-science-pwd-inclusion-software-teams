Paper;Code;Evidency
A100;Survey;We conducted email interviews with four members of the British Computing Association of the Blind (BCAB), where we asked participants who had experience in programming what they would typically search for when attempting to get an overview of a class they have not seen before.
A100;Usability testing;Thirteen participants (ages between 22-60) took part in an evaluation study
A114;Usability testing;"We compare AudioHighlight to the state of the art in code skimming represented by a previous code skimming approach called StructJumper. We also compare to the state of practice in reading code on the web as represented by GitHub
In Evaluation 1, we used the same tasks and code as the StructJumper evaluation. // In Evaluation 2, we asked the participants to read and summarize a series of classes using both AudioHighlight and StructJumper
In Evaluation 3, we compared AudioHighlight on the web to GitHub by asking participants to summarize a series of classes using both tools."
A13;Other;We used duoethnography, which is a qualitative research method in which two or more researchers provide different meanings to a common experience.
A13;Interviews;"As a mixed-ability team, we (one author is blind; the other is sighted) immersed ourselves in a collaborative programming project using a popular social coding platform (i.e., GitHub) and triangulated our self-reflexivity through cross-checking interviews."
A136;Survey;After that, to evaluate the accessibility of existing UML modeling tools, we first conducted a survey on the use of these tools by software development companies in the State of Sao Paulo/Brazil, where more than a third of all Brazilian information technology companies are based.
A136;Usability testing;The evaluations were conducted as usability experiments, with three users. One of them is blind and two are sighted.
A145;Survey;We conducted a preliminary survey with an objective to collect opinions from VI developers on IDE accessibility, with a specific focus on Microsoft Visual Studio
A145;Usability testing;The study had four major components: Participant solicitation, user study without and with CodeTalk, and post user study online survey.
A145;Interviews;Four out of the 20 participants of the survey participated in further detailed interviews.
A146;Controlled experiment;We evaluated CodeWalk in a within-subjects controlled experiment involving 10 BVI professional developers(see §5). Our results show that CodeWalk increased study participants’ awareness of their collaborator’s actions and reduced the coordination overhead required to sync on code locations.
A146;Interviews;After each condition, participants verbally responded to a 12 statement Likert-scale questionnaire (see Table 6). The questionnaire was adapted from existing scales [16, 64] and assessed participants’ opinionsregarding awareness and collaboration. Participants had to indicate on a fve pointscale whether they strongly disagreed (1) or strongly agreed (5) with the statements. The study concluded with an informal interview about participants’ experience with CodeWalk and a short questionnaire about their personal and programming background.
A147;Workshop/design;The following section describes how the authors of this paper collaborated to address this usability issue of VSCode accessibility. The co-design methodology fosters a joint creation process between the user and developer, enabling the developer to grasp the user’s requirements and, in turn, develop a product aligning with these needs
A214;Survey;The survey was taken by a total number of 69 participants, all of whom were blind developers. Nearly all 62 (89.86%) of the participants were male, 6 (0.09%) were female, and 1 participant decided not to answer
A241;Interviews;We conducted interviews to gather in-depth data about the challenges faced by blind or visually impaired (BVI) programmers at work and from their learning experiences.
A242;Survey;"Before participating in the study, users were required to complete a short preliminary survey that asked participants to provide demographic information, programming experience information, and information about the accessibility tools commonly used by the participant.

The survey at the end of each trial then asks the user questions about their overall experience with auditory cues."
A242;Usability testing;The study consists of three trials using a different type of auditory cue for each trial. Participants used their typical screen readers for all tasks. For the first test, participants were provided with a pregenerated block of source code and were thentasked with finding a specific block in the code using the auditory cues available. Participants were timed on how long it took them to find the designated code block. For the second test, participants were asked to listen to a short audio description of a set of source code. Participants then wrote down their interpretation of the source code’s structure.
A250;Controlled experiment;In this short paper an open data set is described which contains the eye tracking recordings from an experiment in which programmers with and without dyslexia reviewed and described Java code
A250;Interviews;"Each session was conducted by a single researcher
Then, the preliminary participant questionnaire was completed to collect profile information such as age, programming experience, self-assessment of energy level and, if applicable, information about their dyslexia"
A269;Usability testing;"From time to time, they provided feedback, reported bugs, and requested new features via emails. Upon receiving feedback, a bug report, or a feature request, two authors of this paper discussed how to resolve the issue gracefully and quickly deployed a solution. This cycle continued for 2 months until the prototype became stable and received encouraging feedback from the participants.

We recruited 12 BLV participants (11 males, 1 female) through local mailing lists, university mailing lists, and public posts on online groups for BLV users. Our inclusion criteria included adult BLV individuals with basic Python skills who are fuent in English."
A269;Interviews;In the end, we engaged in open-ended discussion, including their preferred editor, potential use case for each editor, usage patterns, and task performances.
A279;Interviews;Interviews were conducted with each participant, either by telephone or by video conference.
A3;Usability testing;"Each research session consisted of two sections: 1) An observational section and 2) an in-depth interview section

participants were asked to share a window on their screen over the teleconferencing software and to perform a predefned task, which required navigating online API documentation for the open-source Go programming language, to fnd a package and function given specifc criteria."
A3;Interviews;"Each research session consisted of two sections: 1) An observational section and 2) an in-depth interview section

We then used these observations to scafold a longer conversation in in-depth interviews about information seeking while engaged in professional coding, which were designed to last 60 minutes. We adopted an approach to interviewing based on the Critical Incident Technique [27]."
A305;Survey;"They were then requested to complete a consent form and were redirected to the pre-test questionnaire to collect some demographic information, as well as details of their impairments and technical skills.

Participants were then administered the SUS survey [4] followed by an online open-ended questionnaire exploring their experiences of using the speech-based code navigation features, as well as suggestions for any improvements."
A305;Usability testing;The navigation techniques were evaluated in a user study with developers who have physical impairments (N=14) where it was found they supported all users in successfully completing a range of standard code navigation tasks
A305;Interviews;We initially conducted interviews with fve developers who have physical impairments to understand further their current methods for navigating code within voice-controlled editors.
A312;Other;"CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY?

In this work, we used observations and semi-structured interviews with blind programmers to identify code navigation difficulties, the tools they used, and any workarounds they employ. This methodology will help us gain deeper insight, relative to our prior survey-based study in [1]

As methodological inspiration, we have drawn upon the recent work of Szpiro et al., who conducted a study using contextual inquiry and qualitative data analysis to understand the challenges faced by people with low vision when accessing computing devices "
A312;Interviews;In this work, we used observations and semi-structured interviews with blind programmers to identify code navigation difficulties, the tools they used, and any workarounds they employ. This methodology will help us gain deeper insight, relative to our prior survey-based study in [1]
A375;Other;"Data Mining
Our study is based on a public archive of emails from a mailing list called Program-L, a discussion group for BLV computer programmers. The community’s archive goes back to November 2004, however the group has been active since as early as the 1990s [17]."
A376;Controlled experiment;To collect examples of people speaking programs to a hypothetical system, we conducted a remote user study.
A376;Survey;Finally, they completed a questionnaire that asked about their experience during the study.
A379;Usability testing;"We present 3 Wizard of Oz prototypes to facilitate communication between the assistive technology user and the other employees in the department.

From all the observations and research conducted, six Wizard-of-Oz prototypes were made. Given page limitations, our results describe three in no particular order.

The employees are co-located, so communication is expected to occur in real time. We created low-fidelity prototypes to streamline communication. By clustering features and interactions into themes observed across our prototypes, the need for improved automation and social conventions surfaced."
A379;Interviews;After collecting data through interviews and on-site observations, we focused on creating low-fidelity prototypes targeting streamlined communication.
A379;Other;"CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY

In this project, we are aiming to bridge that gap between accessibility and collaborative technology by employing Contextual Inquiry methods [4]. After collecting data through interviews and on-site observations, we focused on creating low-fidelity prototypes targeting streamlined communication.
This approach requires a holistic view of the workplace, so we went on-site and observed the work environment that surrounds the user along with everyone’s level of satisfaction with their space by performing a Contextual Inquiry [1].
Several people simultaneously observed a handful of employees as they engaged in their everyday work activities (minus any sensitive work that should not be shared) across one afternoon. We independently recorded our observations as we rotated through the office to different employees’ desks."
A380;Usability testing;"To explore the value of the PSST dashboard to end users, we recruited two BVI individuals and observed them using the dashboard.

We then introduced participants to the PSST dashboard and gave them the list of tasks mentioned above. We asked participants open-ended questions about each sensor involved in a task before and after the task. We then returned to interviewing, to fnd out what they liked. 

All sessions were videotaped with two cameras and a software screen recorder to capture both the screen and the Jacdac hardware participants were interacting with. We reviewed researcher memos, notes taken during the study, and transcripts to identify themes, which we then discussed as a team."
A380;Interviews;We started with a semi-structured interview. We asked participants to tell us about their experience with using sensors in programming, what worked, and things that they felt did not work wel
A409;Usability testing;To evaluate StructJumper, seven blind programmers completed three tasks, while using StructJumper and without the tool
A409;Interviews;"The study was divided into three parts, completing a series of tasks with our tool, completing a series of tasks without our tool and the post-session interview. 

This was also a common type of task that participants mentioned in the interviews that that the tool would be helpful for."
A429;Case study;In order to evaluate the AWMo approach, a case study was conducted with one subject [14] and later on with a second subject that allowed us to gather more data and enrich the work with comparative analysis of the executions.
A429;Interviews;This study was composed of three phases: an initial interview to know the subjects, an observation phase where the subject performed a series of pre established tasks with AWMo on an instrumented computer and finally a final interview to collect the user thoughts and more subjective data regarding the tool and the performed tasks.
A463;Interviews;We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 people with visual impairments who are employed as software developers, data analysts, IT professionals, and researchers
A464;Other;As indicated by STGT, we started with a Lean Literature review (briefly reported on subsection 2.2) to confirm limited prior research
A464;Interviews;We were able to reach out to 9 neurodiverse developers, but only 4 of them accepted (Table 1) to be interviewed.
A478;Interviews;Para as entrevistas, foram selecionados profissionais que trabalhavam com qualquer método ágil há pelo menos um ano.
A520;Other;"[Literature Review]
This research has been carried out using both grey and white literature, non-academic sources and peer reviewed papers, adopting Multivocal Literature Review [10]."
A533;Other;Opinion
A543;Interviews;"The semi-structured interviews allowed us to build knowledge by listening to and interpreting the participants’ individual experiences and learning [13]. We performed 3 rounds of interviews through video calls made by the first author: (1) preliminary interviews with software developers from underrepresented groups; (2) managers of software companies that have D&I policies; and (3) developers belonging to underrepresented groups in such companies."
A560;Controlled experiment;To investigate the hypotheses, we compared the above metrics across groups - dyslexia group and control group.
A560;Interviews;For each program, the participant was asked to read the code and then describe to the investigator the program’s purpose. In addition, participants completed a short profiling questionnaire, capturing data such as preferred programming language, programming experience and a self assessment of fatigue. On this questionnaire participants also indicated if they had dyslexia and were asked to provide a self-assessment rating of their dyslexia as mild, moderate or severe. For each participant, the investigators also completed a comprehension assessment on a scale of 1-10 (1 = no understanding through 10 = full understanding).
A577;Survey;In this paper, we present the first study of neurodiverse software developers, via interview and survey data.
A577;Interviews;We employed a semi-structured interview approach, starting with a set of core questions, but sometimes adding or removing questions based on a particular interviewee’s background, interests, and responses
A579;Other;The action research method was considered the most appropriate because of the need for collaboration between researchers and participants, the qualitative nature of the results, the complexity of the evaluated system and the need to perform multiple social experiments to achieve the best possible result
A61;Usability testing;In the second study, six developers with visual impairments used a CLI for a period of two weeks and refected on the accessibility issues they encountered in an interview session
A61;Interviews;The first study was a set of semi-structured interviews with six developers who use CLIs and screen readers to understand their perception on CLI accessibility
A64;Usability testing;We assessed four prototyping tools (Sketch, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, and UXPin) individually with two screen readers (VoiceOver and Narrator) for accessibility. We selected these prototyping tools for their popularity, and we selected non-web-based screen readers for their popularity and cost. For each tool, we assessed the accessibility of software-wide elements such as Buttons, Textview, Image, and so on. Then we examined critical workfows based on designed tasks (e.g., tasks required to create a prototype). Finally, we conducted a cursory check on the prototype to determine if it was operable with the screen reader.
A65;Interviews;we followed this with 18 semi-structured interviews with programmers with visual impairments who have explored or used UI frameworks and libraries as part of coursework and professional responsibilities
A65;Other;We scraped the archived posts dated from January 2018 to December 2021 from the program-l mailing list (program-l@freelists.org)—an active and free discussion group for programmers with visual impairments to ask questions and share resources
A74;Usability testing;To evaluate CMB thirteen blind programmers completed three tasks using two browser-based environments: CMB as the experiment and a browser textarea element as the control.
A74;Interviews;After participants had completed the tasks, we asked them questions about their experience
A76;Survey;Participants were asked to provide demographic information in a pre-study survey hosted on SurveyMonkey. This survey asked participants to provide information regarding their level of vision, programming experience, experience with block-based programming, and with screen readers
A76;Usability testing;To answer the research question, we conducted a study in which 12 blind programmers accomplished navigation tasks using Accessible Blockly and Blockly’s alternate navigation scheme as control
A76;Interviews;After completing both phases, participants were asked open-ended questionsregarding their overall experience using both navigation schemes
A79;Interviews;interviews with blind Web developers that were shaped in part by findings of the CLR.
A79;Other;"Comprehensive Literature Review (CLR) of existing data from traditional literature review sources, blog posts, email list threads, and observations from our previously published research.

CLR is a systematic approach to establishing a literature review from multiple sources as a methodology. Here, we have employed a CLR to bring together multiple viewpoints that may not be present in a traditional literature review. The process includes traditional literature searches (books, articles, proceedings, etc.) and involves expanding the search to include one or more MODES (Media, Observation, Documents, Experts), before final analysis and synthesis of information"
A8;Survey;After one hour the participant was taken to an exit survey. this survey was the same exit survey that was used at the end of the eye-tracking study. The survey asked the following questions:
A8;Usability testing;We emailed a study packet to each participant consisting of a study application and a cursor tracking script. The study application presented a series of methods to the participant inside of a Notepad session and prompted them to submit their summaries and any comments in a separate window. The application terminated after one hour and took the participant to an exit survey.
A87;Other;"Literature REview
This paper reports on a review of accessibility research efforts geared towards making programming and programming environments accessible to professional programmers with visual impairments and students with visual impairments learning how to code. This includes work that seeks to investigate and understand accessibility barriers as well as research efforts that propose solutions to overcome these barriers and make programming friendlier to people with visual impairments"
