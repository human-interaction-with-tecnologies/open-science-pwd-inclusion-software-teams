A3;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;Our findings indicate that interpersonal dynamics in professional development teams influence the overall accessibility of development for DWVI, and there is an opportunity for further investigation in this space
A64;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;The inability to use screen readers to independently operate and navigate prototyping tools propagated through to other aspects of accessibility and, we argue, would ultimately affect usability
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;Consistent with prior work, we confirmed that GUI builders in most IDEs were not accessible with screen readers
A136;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;This study showed that not all UML diagrams are accessible and there is a challenging scenario for the inclusion of blind developers in the industry, making further researches important in this area
A241;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;For RQ1, we learned that the main barriers encountered in the workplace are 1) workplace dynamics, 2) the inaccessibility of specific software tools, and 3) specific programming tasks too challenging for BVI programmers.
A312;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;Assistive technologies and specific accessibility features of some IDEs did not provide adequate support to enable users to navigate through code comfortably. Although some users were able to customize their assistive technology to better convey the information displayed by the IDE and trigger specific commands, the inefficiency of code navigation made participants feel a loss of control, and they often reported disorientation in the code
A242;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;The postsurvey data shows the participant’s overall thoughts on the Blockly program. Earcons were rated to be the worse auditory cue chosen for the experiment while spearcons were shown to roughly match regular speech when conveying the nesting level.
A376;Motor/physical impairment;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;These insights support our approach of collecting data by asking participants to speak code without imposing any rules, as it enables the system to account for the diverse ways in which people might speak code
A380;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;In addition to demonstrating that PSST is accessible itself and also makes physical computing more accessible, our study shows that lack of access has a desultory effect on what people may think is interesting or worth doing
A64;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;The prototyping tools we assessed were largely incompatible with the screen readers used.
A3;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;As a collective, our findings suggest that, even in the highly technical domain of software development, understanding accessibility requires attending to contextual and social factors—outside of the IDE
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;The situation is exacerbated by the lack of (official) documentation and online resources that discuss accessibility. In the case of UI development, they complicate the processes of code writing, debugging, and ensuring accessibility with screen readers.
A136;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;The solutions that are more likely to be used in industry are not available to the public and seem to be restricted to the research context. The only available tool found, TeDUB, only allows the reading of some diagrams without editing the features
A312;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;Most of our participants preferred to use a screen reader (despite its limitations) to write software code. Others found this difficult, and therefore, favored using a braille display instead. However, several of our participants indicated that they could not afford to purchase a braille display
A242;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;The advantage of spearcons over speech lies in the amount of time needed to convey meaning.
A64;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;We present the results of our investigation, showing that prototyping tools are largely not accessible via screen readers, with the most accessible dyads VoiceOver-Sketch, VoiceOver-Balsamiq, and Narrator-Balsamiq. Our findings comprise an empirical contribution, providing data about how well prototyping tools can be used with screen readers, describing the severity of problems that prevent accessibility, and ofering suggestions for improving specifc application accessibility
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;our findings show that accessibility issues cannot be isolated to any particular programming tool or activity. They result from the interactions between the various software that make the programming environment — IDEs, browser developer tools, UI frameworks and libraries, operating systems, and screen readers Accessibility challenges are difficult to isolate to programming tools or UI frameworks and libraries
A136;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;The most inaccessible interfaces were of Astah, Jude and Smartdraw, for which none of the menu options were read by JAWS, making it impossible to know in which option or context the user was.
A312;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;Our findings indicated that participants struggled to navigate through codebases using existing development software alongside assistive technologies (e.g., screen reader). Although accessibility tools provided benefits, they failed to give enough support for blind programmers to navigate through codebases quickly and comfortably.
A64;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;In all, there was no perfect combination of screen reader prototype dyads. In addition, we observed slight differences in screen readers. Specifically, VoiceOver-AdobeXD and VoiceOver UXPin had better accessibility than Narrator-AdobeXD and Narrator-UXPin. VoiceOver-AdobeXD had higher task completion rates and lower iaerNS and iaerPS. Meanwhile, Narrator-Balsamiq assessed better than VoiceOver-Balsamiq
A312;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;"Programming software (e.g., IDEs) did not meet participants’ needs for code navigation; they regularly struggled when performing typical programming activities with these tools. Nevertheless, participants still preferred to use IDEs, even though they encountered these navigation difficulties"
A64;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;This diference ultimately made Balsamiq slighty more accessible to use with screen readers than the other tools.
A64;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;Although VoiceOver-Sketch had the highest task completion rate, and the lowest iaerNS score, in a practical sense, Balsamiq was a more accessible choice with more efcient ways to execute tasks and overall better screen reader access across all functions
A64;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Tools' Perspective;Accessibility Issues;;We note that a function of VoiceOver, called rotor, accelerated navigation across the hundreds of GUI elements included in the prototyping tools.
A520;Neurodivergent;Company's Perspective;;;Our research shows that companies have started to seriously engage the autism-friendly software engineering space
A520;Neurodivergent;Company's Perspective;;;Technology companies can benefit greatly from the unique abilities and characteristics autistic software developers possess such as attention to detail, finding comfort in repetitive behaviour and the ability to visualise problems
A543;Neurodivergent;Company's Perspective;;;Also, some groups such as neurodivergent people and people with disabilities are somehow forgotten, with their agendas being barely discussed within the D&I debates in these companies. Thus, the lack of actions aimed at this public can harm the inclusion of these people, or affect the quality of work and professional development of those who are already in the company.
A577;Neurodivergent;Company's Perspective;;;Our survey also reinforces the interviewees’ opinions that working in shared or open plan offices and dealing with the people skills aspects of software development were more problematic for neurodiverse employees.
A577;Neurodivergent;Company's Perspective;;;Our findings suggest that a not-insubstantial minority of software development employees at Microsoft have neurodiverse cognitive profiles. Companies like Microsoft may underestimate the pervasiveness of these issues because most impacted individuals are unlikely to disclose their status to HR or management for fear of judgment or discrimination. Further, many affected employees may not even realize the nature of their condition until many years after joining a company, as adulthood diagnosis was quite common
A379;(Other) Blind-Deaf;Company's Perspective;;;From this contextual inquiry, we saw what it takes to keep a steady pace in the workplace and saw a range of accommodations that are needed to include all types of employees in the company workflow.
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Company's Perspective;;;Furthermore, workplace dynamics complicated the implementation of accessibility. P10 mentioned that the changes had to be approved by senior management, who may consider the trade-offs between his productivity as a developer and the time it would take to improve the accessibility
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Company's Perspective;;;The programming experiences of our participants were likely shaped by the workplace norms and laws specific to their country and culture
A241;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Company's Perspective;;;1) Workplace Dynamics. Common amongst the discussions was the type of interactions with the coworkers. 4 and P10 recall experiences of team settings where coworkers often have trouble determining how to send visual information in a format that is readable by a screen reader
A3;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;accessibility may impact DWVIs’ software development experience, even where no behavioral differences are observable. As a collective, our findings suggest that, even in the highly technical domain of software development, understanding accessibility requires attending to contextual and social factors—outside of the IDE.
A3;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;These findings suggest that, even in a highly accessible technical environment, professional DWVI may never truly be able to operate fully independently for the same reason DWNSVI may not be able to operate fully independently—the collaborative nature of their job
A520;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Professional Carreer;;Research shows that autistic individuals possess many of the analytical skills required by software developers including programming, math, problem-solving and debugging [9, 16].
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;P16 further added that in remote client meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic, poor demonstrations could disclose his disability and reinforce ableist perceptions about his ability and competence as a programmer
A312;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;Participants felt uncomfortable disclosing their programming needs (e.g., navigation difficulties) and their disability status to colleagues or researchers, which may prevent them from understanding the need to improve the accessibility of IDEs
A520;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Professional Carreer;;This research finds that autistic individuals are more likely to pursue STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) related subjects in postsecondary education compared to non-STEM subjects
A577;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Professional Carreer;;Our survey findings also reinforce the suggestion of our interviewees that neurodiverse software developers perceive themselves as more skillful at focusing intensely on tasks and noticing patterns in code than neurotypical employees
A463;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;Most participants, independent of the country they resided and worked in, hesitated to ask their employers to provide them with commercially available ATs like JAWS, ZoomText, and braille displays. Participants felt their employers would perceive it as an expensive request and felt uncomfortable asking their “boss to spend so much money” (P12). A few participants felt their request would be seen as “excuses” (P23). Given the challenges in fnding employment, participants preferred to not emphasize lack of access as it may be misinterpreted as a lack of programming ability. Thus, participants preferred switching to free and open-source alternatives or using their personal licenses instead of asking employers to provide the resources they were profcient with.
A464;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;personal Insights;;Emotional and social factors influenced the well-being and performance of neurodivergent individuals. Shifting from self-blame to self-acceptance and finding effective strategies for personal growth was important.
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Professional Carreer;;Participants shared that being familiar with UI development improved their chances of being hired, even though their preferred job roles were back-end development
A79;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Professional Carreer;;Screen reader users are dynamic and adaptive problem solvers, and we need to inquire about their next steps and strategies when faced with usability problems
A520;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;personal Insights;;This research finds that those working in technology with autism experienced challenges compared to their neurotypical peers due to the lack of understanding of the diversity talents of autistic individuals
A13;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;more intuitive audio representations of code insertions and deletions will improve code-reviewing experiences for blind programmers
A214;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;Some of the results were expected such as the lack of accessibility in IDEs as well as the use of a screen reader. We were surprised to see that blind developers use text editors as preferred tools to write code. It is not clear whether blind developers are unaware of the variety of features offered within the IDEs or find them difficult to use.
A242;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;Earcons were rated to be the worse auditory cue chosen for the experiment while spearcons were shown to roughly match regular speech when conveying the nesting level. The advantage of spearcons over speech lies in the amount of time needed to convey meaning.
A250;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;summary, the results suggested that there was no significant interaction effect between dyslexia and crowding with respect to comprehension time or performance
A250;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;With reference to gaze, results also suggested that crowding does not lead to any detrimental reading performance for the programmer with dyslexia, although there are some further questions to explore.
A305;Motor/physical impairment;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;Our work also confirms that voice is a feasible approach in facilitating a wide range of code navigation approaches and can help developers with physical impairments to reduce their dependency on traditional input devices
A312;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;Since navigation options in IDEs are restricted to sighted users, blind programmers prefer simpler editors (e.g., Notepad, Notepad++). Participants explained and demonstrated  how diverse programming environments, in combination with assistive technologies, lead to various challenges, often because these IDEs were designed without accessibility in mind.
A560;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;Taking all of the data into account, there is no strong evidence to suggest that programmers with dyslexia have shorter saccades than the control group
A560;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;The important outcome is not that saccade length per se is broadly the same for the two programmer groups but that, as an indicator of a difference in reading behaviour for dyslexic readers, it is not readily apparent when reading code
A560;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;Nevertheless, as a tentative observation, the data is suggesting gaze behaviour in keeping with hypothesis 2 - programmers with dyslexia exhibiting a proportion of linear saccades less than the proportion associated with the control group or, in other words, more non-linear gaze behaviour.
A560;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;When testing hypothesis 2, while the statistically significant data is limited, the tendency points to less linearity in the gaze of the programmer with dyslexia.
A560;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;In probing the differences between the dyslexia and control groups, while there is limited significant difference, the analysis does open the question as to whether, for the programmer with dyslexia, a different visual-spatial approach to code comprehension is at work, aligning with possible strengths in their performance in holistic visualization tasks.
A8;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Technical behaviours;;We found statistically-significant evidence that blind and sighted programmers both prioritized method signatures when reading code. Blind programmers read method invocations less than sighted programmers. Both groups focused less on control flow keywords than the rest of the method. There was no statistically-significant difference between the perceived quality of the summaries produced by either group
A577;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;"neurodiverse employees reported significantly less comfort with synchronous forms of communication than their neurotypical peers;"
A577;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;most of the employees had not officially disclosed their neurodiversity.
A577;Neurodivergent;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;As with our ten interviewees, the fiftynine neurodiverse respondents tended to be diagnosed in adulthood, and the majority did not disclose this diagnosis to management or their human resources (HR) department.
A79;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Personal Insights;;The levels of severity seemed to take on additional meaning with blind developers, because they did not want to be seen as less capable than sighted developers.
A13;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;more technologies should be designed to support collaboration in programming. the use of collaboration tools such as GitHub has been underexplored in this regard
A214;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;Participants were asked to clarify the method used to learn programming. About 40 (57.97%) were self-taught, 28 (40.58%) attended schools, and 1 (0.01%) respondent did not answer the question
A241;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;Company's Perspective;;;For RQ1, we learned that the main barriers encountered in the workplace are 1) workplace dynamics, 2) the inaccessibility of specific software tools, and 3) specific programming tasks too challenging for BVI programmers.
A3;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;Broadly speaking, we found that the information sources our participants used were highly similar to those used by DWNSVI, as documented in prior literature.
A3;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;For example, {P3} shared that he typically likes to work alone, but needs to exchange information with others because “when I’m working with another human being, it’s really to solve a problem that the machine has already failed to address. And so documentation can be great, you can interconnect all of these topics and teach us what we need to know. But, it can’t actively problem solve.”
A3;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;examining development as an information seeking process emphasized the importance of when and why accessibility issues arise, and how they are overcome, which indicate the influence of contextual and social factors that make some aspects of accessible development more critical and complex to address than others.
A312;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;Although some blind programmers seek sighted help, others prefer writing custom scripts to overcome many programming challenges
A312;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;Moreover, some blind programmers may seek sighted help for various reasons, mostly to access content that is not accessible with assistive technologies
A375;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;Our analysis of the Program-L archive showed some interesting help-seeking behaviors that differ from mainstream Q&A sites like Stack Overflow. When introducing themselves, Program-L novices described their personal experience with their disability and the hardware and software they use to program computers. In addition to asking others for help & responding to their questions about technology, they also reached further, asking others to contact them and help them directly with their task.
A375;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;Our data show that novices in Program-L followed a particular set of norms and behaviors when asking for help
A463;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;Beyond help-seeking, there can be challenges for programmers with visual impairments in giving help
A463;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;The accessibility challenges in the ecosystem affect collaboration and help-seeking practices in mixed-ability contexts.
A579;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;This study has shown that with specific adjustments it is possible to allow a blind individual to participate in all stages of software development even if the team uses visual management.
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;While sighted developers can turn to large forums like Stack Overflow, the recourse for programmers with visual impairments is to reach out to one another and report the accessibility problems to the developer teams.
A65;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;The situation is exacerbated by the lack of (official) documentation and online resources that discuss accessibility. In the case of UI development, they complicate the processes of code writing, debugging, and ensuring accessibility with screen readers. They also impact collaboration between programmers with visual impairments and their sighted colleagues since they use different approaches to UI development
A79;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Collaboration;;P2 and P4 described community support tools to establish a collaborative community of learning and practice
A79;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Professional Carreer;;Several participants (P2, P4, P7, P8, P11) told us that they have mostly shied away from front-end web development and in their professional lives have gravitated to companies/organizations that structure work around a division of labor between front-end and back-end web development
A463;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;PwD Perspective;Professional Carreer;;Accessibility challenges in UI development also shaped many participants’ decisions to pursue programming that would require them to deal with the front end as little as possible: It’s easier that there are far fewer accessibility concerns with back end and as far as its employment goes, they have a need for it. – P9
