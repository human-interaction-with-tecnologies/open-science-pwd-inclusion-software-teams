A100;Artifact;We design the Auditory Code Overview and Navigation Tool (ACONT) as an attempt to support the task of a programmer quickly scrolling through a class file in order for them to gain a quick understanding of its structure
A114;Artifact;In this paper, we adapt the virtual cursor model to enable code skimming. We add heading tags to class and function declarations as well as control flow statements such as if statements and for loops. This allows a blind programmer to quickly cycle through the heading tags at a particular level and for example move through all the functions inside a class. Blind users already use this strategy to quickly navigate to important sections of webpages [9]. We also present an eclipse plugin that allows a programmer to read the currently open file in the virtual cursor.
A145;Artifact;We propose solutions to address a subset of the identified issues and implement these solutions as CodeTalk, a plugin for Visual Studio.
A146;Artifact;In this paper, we present CodeWalk, a set of features added to Microsoft’s Live Share VS Code extension1 (available to all Live Share users since November 2021), with support for remote, synchronous code review and refactoring tasks
A269;Artifact;In this paper, we introduce Grid-Coding paradigm, a fresh perspective on non-visual programming that addresses the code navigation, editing, and associated challenges with text-based programming languages for BLV programmers
A305;Artifact;The navigation techniques were evaluated in a user study with developers who have physical impairments (N=14) where it was found they supported all users in successfully completing a range of standard code navigation tasks
A379;Artifact;"The prototypes we offer provide synchronous communication methods in all types of environments to reduce the amount of bottlenecked communication found in the workplace.

We created low-fidelity prototypes to streamline communication."
A380;Artifact;We combine real-time data sonifcation techniques and screen reader interactions to build these auditory displays and provide a tool for BVI developers to build their own auditory displays
A409;Artifact;Our tool, StructJumper, expands on this work by creating a hierarchical tree of the nesting structure of a program (see Figures 1, 2 and 3) to allow users to both navigate within the program and gain an understanding of the structure of code within the program
A429;Artifact;The AWMo is a prototype tool developed by the authors in the search of a proposal that would enable blind and visually impaired software developers to work with graphical software models and diagrams
A74;Artifact;This paper presents the toolkit and a first evaluation of it.
A76;Artifact;"It presents the design and implementation of Accessible Blockly; a block-based programming library augmented with keyboard and screen reader interaction mechanisms."
A250;Dataset;In this paper we present the artefacts and data from the experiment as a resource which we hope might lead to further work in this specific area
A376;Dataset;We release the frst data set containing individual lines of code and the transcripts of how programmers spoke those lines
A100;Empirical;"We conducted email interviews with four members of the British Computing Association of the Blind (BCAB), where we asked participants who had experience in programming what they would typically search for when attempting to get an overview of a class they have not seen before

We measured the time it took participants to complete their overviews and logged their interactions.

At the end of all tests, participants answered a Likert Scale questionnaire which related to their experience with each type of sound display (Fig 3), which we followed by an unstructured interview which allowed participants to expand on their answers."
A114;Empirical;Our evaluations found that participants took less time to complete a task using AudioHighlight. Participants performed better or equally when using AudioHighlight as compared to StructJumper and GitHub. Finally, participants perceived the tasks to be easier when using AudioHighlight.
A13;Empirical;We used duoethnography, which is a qualitative research method in which two or more researchers provide different meanings to a common experience.
A136;Empirical;In this context, this paper aims to assess the availability and accessibility of solutions for the inclusion of blind people in activities focused on the creation and editing of UML diagrams, allowing the inclusion of these people in computer education programs and in the software development industry.
A145;Empirical;We present feedback that validates our approach by an exploratory user study with six VI developers using CodeTalk
A146;Empirical;Validation of our design’s capability to increase shared awareness and facilitate efcient synchronization during remote collaboration, meeting our design criteria
A147;Empirical;This paper is the empirical product of blind and sighted developers who have thought deeply about these issues and actively collaborated.
A214;Empirical;In this work, we explored the challenges faced by developers who are blind. The goal was to understand the blind developers’ programming problems as well as their workarounds to overcome these challenges.
A241;Empirical;Our work seeks to examine how programmers adapt within their work environment and how the impact of their visual impairment coupled with workplace constraints (e.g., programming language or tool use) affects their contributions to their teams
A242;Empirical;The postsurvey data shows the participant’s overall thoughts on the Blockly program. Earcons were rated to be the worse auditory cue chosen for the experiment while spearcons were shown to roughly match regular speech when conveying the nesting level. The advantage of spearcons over speech lies in the amount of time needed to convey meaning.
A250;Empirical;The present experiment was devised to investigate the interaction effect of crowding and dyslexia. Preliminary results are presented in [McChesney and Bond 2021], focusing on comprehension time, comprehension performance and gaze behaviour as measured by visit count, visit duration, time to first fixation and first visit duration.
A269;Empirical;The study also revealed how BLV programmers adopted Grid-Coding and demonstrated novel interaction patterns conducive to increased programming productivity
A279;Empirical;"We aim to identify the experiences of web interface designers who are blind. The long-term goal is to design a solution to better support their needs

CONSIDERAR ESSE: we describe the findings from a data gathering study conducted to identify the ways in which blind web developers develop and edit web sites and online applications."
A3;Empirical;our work expands on these insights by examining whether and how visual abilities and screen reader use afect information behaviors within the specialized information sources used in software development.
A305;Empirical;"We initially conducted interviews with five developers who have physical impairments to understand further their current methods for navigating code within voice-controlled editors.

Findings from this exploratory study were used to inform the development of an editor containing diferent code navigation approaches that can be operated via multimodal speech input."
A312;Empirical;In summary, our findings provide greater empirical evidence about the need to improve code navigation features in IDEs for blind programmers, and it identifies opportunities for researchers and industry for addressing these needs
A375;Empirical;Our work contributes the following: 1) an exploration of help seeking behaviors demonstrated by BLV novices in an online programming community. 2) an understanding of how disability self-disclosure is an important aspect of communication even in a community already dedicated to those with disabilities.
A376;Empirical;In this work, we aim to investigate how programmers speak individual lines or small segments of code.
A379;Empirical;By clustering features and interactions into themes observed across our prototypes, the need for improved automation and social conventions surfaced.
A380;Empirical;Finally, through a study with two BVI developers using the PSST dashboard to perform tasksthat map to our design goals, we validate the toolkit’s ability to enable BVI developers to understand sensor data
A409;Empirical;The results from our evaluation of our tool, which show that StructJumper is useful in helping blind developers navigate code and gain an understanding of which statements a line of code is nested within
A429;Empirical;"By analyzing the footage collected during the case study containing both the computer screen and the users faces we identified navigation strategies the subjects used to navigate inside AWMo and how these strategies evolved during the course of the experiment.

In this study we have analyzed the data evaluating the navigation strategies used by the participants both on the application as a whole and inside textual editor."
A463;Empirical;An analysis of our interviews with programmers with visual impairments, which provides insights into the logistics of working in mixed-ability workplaces.
A464;Empirical;"Our objective is to explore the challenges faced by developers with ASD
and ADHD and investigate how adjustments to agile practices can enhance their comfort and overall team outcomes"
A478;Empirical;A pesquisa possibilitou a identificação e o entendimento dos principais desafios enfrentados por times ágeis para facilitar a inclusão e integração de profissionais com deficiência (PCD), culminando na proposta de um catálogo de técnicas que podem ser utilizadas para apoiar um processo de desenvolvimento de software mais inclusiv
A543;Empirical;Here, we investigate other companies adopting D&I policies, but we contrast the points of view of management people with the points of view of developers belongin
A560;Empirical;In this paper we build on recent work which has sought to investigate if programmers with dyslexia read program code in a way which is different from programmers without dyslexia
A577;Empirical;"Understanding the perspectives and experiences of technology workers with ASD and other cognitive differences is important (...) it is important to understand whether such 
employees face unique challenges in achieving success in computing careers."
A579;Empirical;This study has shown that with specific adjustments it is possible to allow a blind individual to participate in all stages of software development even if the team uses visual management.
A61;Empirical;This paper investigated the accessibility of command-line interfaces through two studies with developers with visual impairments. We found that despite being text-based and keyboard-operable, CLIs sufer from their own set of accessibility issues: unstructured text, lack of status and progress indication, lack of screen-reader friendly progress indicators and inaccessible error messages
A64;Empirical;We assessed tool conformance to accessibility guidelines, and examined workfows for prototype creation. We present the results of our investigation, showing that prototyping tools are largely not accessible via screen readers, with the most accessible dyads VoiceOver-Sketch, VoiceOver-Balsamiq, and Narrator-Balsamiq
A65;Empirical;"An understanding of how accessibility challenges hindered code writing, testing, and demonstrations for programmers with visual impairments.

Evidence that accessibility challenges are difficult to isolate to programming tools or UI framework"
A74;Empirical;Visually-impaired programmers completed several tasks with and without our tool, and we compared their results and experience
A76;Empirical;Our contribution in this paper includes a prototype of an accessibility library, an analysis and results of the evaluation of the library for navigating block-based code, and fnally, refections on how to improve the accessibility of block-based programming environments.
A8;Empirical;We found statistically-significant evidence that blind and sighted programmers both prioritized method signatures when reading code. Blind programmers read method invocations less than sighted programmers. Both groups focused less on control flow keywords than the rest of the method. There was no statistically-significant difference between the perceived quality of the summaries produced by either group.
A520;Literature Review;The primary objective of the exercise was to research the topic in the allocated time frame and to present the findings in this research paper. Having defined the key themes, search strings were identified around each theme and they were executed in combination across Google Scholar, individual publisher digital archives, including IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Google
A61;Literature Review;In this paper, we review two particular areas of literature most relevant to our research on CLI accessibility - i) understanding the needs of developers with visual impairments and ii) building accessible developer tools
A79;Literature Review;The CLR helped to identify a wide range of screen reader accessibility issues that exist in processes related to learning and the practice of computer programming
A87;Literature Review;The goal of this study is to examine current scholarship on the accessibility of programming languages and programming environments for people with visual impairments.
A533;Opinion;We propose that urgent policy changes are required to remedy the present situation and solve problem (2). The starting point must be the identification of the group that is affected, with sensitivity to its heterogeneity.This involves collecting relevant data in ethically acceptable ways, thus solving problem (1)
A145;Theoretical;We present a classification of accessibility issues in four headings: discoverability, glanceability, navigability, and alertability and provide illustrative examples of each kind.
A146;Theoretical;"A design for supporting tightly-coupled synchronous programming activities.
Based on this literature review, we synthesize the following design criteria for CodeWalk. D1. to minimize the cognitive load on the BVI developer / D2. to maintain agency of BVI developers / D3. to reduce the burden on BVI developers / D4. to support tightly-coupled collaboration"
A380;Theoretical;A set of design requirements that describes the interaction needs for understanding sensor data, including response speed, calibration, and noisiness
A409;Theoretical;Insights into how designers should create similar navigational tools for blind programmers
A463;Theoretical;A discussion on the accessibility of collaborative activities in programming, and design recommendations grounded in our empirical contributions
A478;Theoretical;A pesquisa possibilitou a identificação e o entendimento dos principais desafios enfrentados por times ágeis para facilitar a inclusão e integração de profissionais com deficiência (PCD), culminando na proposta de um catálogo de técnicas que podem ser utilizadas para apoiar um processo de desenvolvimento de software mais inclusivas
A577;Theoretical;After describing the methodology and findings of our interviews and surveys, we reflect on how these findings might translate into changes in software development workplace and workflow practices that can better support the success of technologists with ASD and more effectively leverage the unique skills and perspectives that they may bring to their jobs.
A61;Theoretical;Based on these fndings, we provided a set of recommendations for improving the accessibility of CLIs
A65;Theoretical;Design recommendations regarding documentation and supporting help-seeking for programmers with visual impairments.
A79;Theoretical;"In this section, we first describe the five Issue Categories in detail as they are found in the traditional literature sources, blogs, email lists, as well as workshop observation. 
From our findings, we are able to summarize web development accessibility issues into the following five categories: visual information without an accessible equivalent, orienting, navigating, lack of support, and use of supportive technology."
A87;Theoretical;We identified and grouped specific programming activities and tasks that have been reported to be challenging to people with visual impairments as well as the interventions that have been proposed to address these challenges. We believe a new review and analysis of the status quo is needed given the recent increase in research activities in this domain
