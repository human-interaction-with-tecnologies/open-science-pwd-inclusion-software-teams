A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Democratize the Web,"Given their widespread use and the advantages they offer, UI frameworks and libraries can have an outsized effect on the accessibility of UI programming and the web"
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Democratize the Web,"this work will contribute to an increase in blind people’s participation in web development and adjacent fields, and ultimately, the accessibility and democratization of the web."
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Social and Economic Inequities,"The opportunities aforded by programming skills may be particularly important for people with visual impairments (PWVI), who currently experience signifcant economic inequities."
A241,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Social and Economic Inequities,"This position to workforce mismatch may create opportunities for blind or visually impaired (BVI) persons who, due to the nature of their disability, have not necessarily been previously considered as candidates for these arguably visually demanding positions"
A463,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Social and Economic Inequities,The steady increase in lucrative programming job opportunities has the potential to positively impact the aspirations and social mobility of programmers with visual impairments.
A533,Neurodivergent,Social and Economic Inequities,"In addition to being a profession of choice for many, for some disabled developers app development may also be one of the limited sources of income available to them, as it comes with fewer structural challenges and allows for self-directed work"
A577,Neurodivergent,Social and Economic Inequities,"For adults with milder forms of ASD (such as Asperger’s Syndrome), finding appropriate employment may be a challenge; many people with ASD are unemployed or underemployed [5], or face discrimination within their workplace [4]"
A463,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Social and Economic Inequities,"This is a small and unsurprising number—people with visual impairments face systemic barriers to employment [15, 58], are less likely to pursue higher education [1], and are less likely to be employed than sighted people [15]."
A533,Neurodivergent,Social and Economic Inequities,"This is a sizeable group and suffices to support the case for investigating current policies with regard to the protection of disabled workers in the Digital Economy, who are not protected through the course of ordinary employment"
A533,Neurodivergent,Social and Economic Inequities,The case of disabled app developers provides a significant example of how the current regulatory framework fails to be inclusive in its attempts to protect the rights of disabled Digital Economy workers.
A533,Neurodivergent,Social and Economic Inequities,"Where work is done outside traditional employment settings, for instance, through freelancing or self-employment, no procedure for recording a disability status is in place, because such (recording) duties are typically part of employment regulations."
A64,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Increase PwD representation in Software Development,"""Improving the accessibility of these design tools also improves opportunities for blind and low vision designers to engage in UI/UX design work."""
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Increase PwD representation in Software Development,The consistent growth of UI developer job roles [6]–[8] also highlights the need to understand and improve the accessibility of the field to make it more inclusive.
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Increase PwD representation in Software Development,"this work will contribute to an increase in blind people’s participation in web development and adjacent fields, and ultimately, the accessibility and democratization of the web."
A147,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Increase PwD representation in Software Development,"These difficulties are a major socio-technical barrier to blind developers reaching their full potential in the computing field and to social and professional participation. From the perspective of the social model [10], which recognizes that an individual’s disability may stem from structures and cultures that sociotechnically limit their access rather than from physical, sensory, cognitive, or emotional issues, we can see that IDE accessibility issues are no longer a group-specifc problem that blind people must endure, but a collective task for the technology community to reduce barriers together."
A242,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Increase PwD representation in Software Development,"With improved accessibility to source code, not only would more people with visual impairments be able to participate in programming"
A8,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"Finally, it is our sincere hope that increased understanding of how blind persons understand code will help employers integrate the blind into the workplace"
A144,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"Productivity increases will likely render blind programmers more competitive in the workplace, where reading and comprehending someone else’s code is a constant demand."
A146,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"Prior to our work, no programming environment with accessible, remote, synchronous co-editing support was publicly available. We have created and released such an environment, in accordance with four design criteria (see §2.4), which include maintaining the agency of BVI developers and reducing their burden to drive the collaboration."
A241,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"Despite these advances there are known challenges and largely unknown obstacles that impact the productivity of BVI programmers and how they collaborate with members of their development team [2]–[4]
There is a need to investigate how the constraints of their work environment, coupled with the challenges of their visual impairment, may affect how they contribute as members of development teams."
A379,(Other) Blind-Deaf,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,The interoperability of collaborative workplace systems with assistive technologies for deaf-blind users is limited to screenreaders used with refreshable braille displays [3]. How can a deaf-blind person collaborate with coworkers in real time?
A478,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"Os trabalhos coletados apenas apresentam um teor geral sobre a discussão, demonstrando aspectos humanos e sociais, mercado de trabalho ou academia, para pessoas portadoras de deficiência na área de tecnologia. O que motivou este trabalho, com o cunho de fomentar o debate sobre este cenário, além de propor melhorias nas práticas identificadas na literatura, para auxiliar portadores de deficiência a exercerem suas atividades dentro do setor de desenvolvimento de software."
A577,Neurodivergent,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"For adults with milder forms of ASD (such as Asperger’s Syndrome), finding appropriate employment may be a challenge; many people with ASD are unemployed or underemployed [5], or face discrimination within their workplace [4]"
A579,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"Some of the questions that arise from this situation involve how to integrate blind developers into sighted teams, how to manage and communicate project progress to them and how to make them feel useful in software construction"
A114,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,We hope that AudioHighlight increases the productivity of blind programmers by allowing them to better skim a piece of code.
A478,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"O papel do portador de deficiência dentro da Engenharia de Software, como desenvolvedor, como líder, como parte de um time, não pode ser definido pelas suas limitações"
A577,Neurodivergent,Promote the inclusion of PwD in the Workplace,"if more companies wish to follow the lead of SAP and Microsoft  and actively recruit people known to have ASD into their  workforce, it is important to understand whether such  employees face unique challenges in achieving success in computing careers."
A8,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,there are no studies that directly compare program comprehension by blind programmers to comprehension by sighted programmers
A61,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"in the real world, developers use multiple tools outside their IDEs like documentation, command-line interfaces, source code repositories, code review tools, etc. There is a lack of research into understanding and improving the accessibility of these tools"
A64,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"However, it is yet undetermined how such tools may be inaccessible for blind or low vision creators, and the extent that the tools themselves result in an inaccessible high-fidelity prototype."
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"To address this gap in the literature, we explore accessibility issues that screen reader users face when learning and practicing web development, the workarounds or strategies they employ, and opportunities to design curricula and tools to better support blind web developers"
A136,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"Although some studies in the literature propose software solutions that enable access for visually impaired people to information present in UML models, it was not clear whether or not any of these solutions were really implemented and available for download. Also, we have not found studies that formally analysed the accessibility of UML modeling tools now being used in computer education programs and in industry"
A146,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"Accessibility and HCI research has primarily studied BVI developers’ as individual contributors, resulting in limited understanding about the accessibility of collaborative programming activities"
A214,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"Currently, the research that highlights difficulties faced by blind developers is limited."
A241,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"Even with prior research into the development of accessible enhancements to existing software development tools [5]–[7], we argue that there is insufficient research into the workplace practice of BVI programmers"
A64,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"Due to little research in this area, our work is initially focused on the operability of prototyping tools with screen readers."
A279,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,relatively limited attention has been given to the needs of interface developers who use assistive technologies to support their work
A376,Motor/physical impairment,Limited research on the theme,Very few studies have been conducted on the natural language use of programming by voice and no robust system currently exists.
A379,Other - Deaf-Blind,Limited research on the theme,"Computing impacts almost every aspect of modern life. In this current wave of computing, designers strive for ubiquitous use across contexts, across platforms, and across users. Yet, there is still much to be explored in the area of accessible technologies for collaborative work."
A305,Motor/physical impairment,Limited research on the theme,current lack of understanding around the potential of alternative methods to support code navigation (to developers with physical impairments)
A380,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"A small body of work has begun to address accessibility of physical computing [7, 36, 52]. However, data visualization has not been a focus of these works."
A463,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,There is a gap in the literature about the challenges programmers face in social contexts
A464,Neurodivergent,Limited research on the theme,"There is also little literature about that aspect. In the pilot study presented here,
we attempt to address the existing knowledge gap on neurodiverse software development teams, focusing on individuals diagnosed with ASD or ADHD"
A533,Neurodivergent,Limited research on the theme,"The Digital Economy, which refers to the economy based on digital computing technologies,10 is one of the fastest growing industries, but little is known about the people involved behind the scenes in this growth"
A463,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"The above collaborative activities have been extensively researched in the context of sighted programmers but remain understudied in mixed-ability contexts. Our study provides a more holistic view of the contextual work practices that develop in mixed-ability teams, revealing the interaction between programming tools, collaboration software, access technologies, and team members"
A463,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,"Challenges in mixed-ability collaborative contexts remain understudied. This is a gap worth examining because of the social, academic, and professional implications it can have for programmers with visual impairments."
A464,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Limited research on the theme,The above studies demonstrate the need to develop a situated understanding of technology use to uncover its social implications for solo and group work. Our research contributes to this growing body of work.
