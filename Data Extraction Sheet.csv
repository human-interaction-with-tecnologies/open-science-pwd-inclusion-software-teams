CLASS OF CODE;CODE;DEFINITION;VALUE;EVIDENCY;
Community of Focus;Blind and/or Visual Impaired;People who are blind, low vision, or generally described as having visual impairments. Does not apply to color vision deficiency nor visual impairments corrected by wearing glasses or contact lenses.;;;
;d/Deaf or hard of hearing ;People with hearing loss or who identify as deaf/Deaf or hard of hearing and use assistive technologies to interact with the computer.;;;
;Motor/physical impairment;People with motor or physical impairments.;;;
;Neurodivergent people (NDV);People with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia and dyscalculia.;;;
;Intellectual and developmental disabilities;Congenital disability that impacts how people develop (e.g., Down syndrome).;;;
;General disability;A paper should be marked as “general disability” if it studied disability or accessibility in general, but no specific subpopulation--for example, looking at what nondisabled people think about disability in general or accessible education for people with disabilities in general (i.e., not a specific group like IDD);;;
;Other;Any communities of focus not already listed.;;;
Issue Addressed;Increase digital access/ease of use;Addresses accessibility or usability issues of digital technology used over the development cycle.;;;
;Increase physical access;Addresses an inaccessible aspect of the physical world to promote the inclusion of PwD on development teams.;;;
;Increase understanding of users;States a goal of learning more about a community, their preferences, difficulties, abilities, etc.;;;
;Increase knowledge of existing literature;States a goal of learning how academic literature presents issues related to PwD in development teams.;;;
;Support communication;The goal was supporting in-person or online communication between persons.;;;
;Support collaboration;The goal was supporting collaboration, i.e., support PwD in working together in a common objective with other team members.;;;
;(Other) - Open Code;Any issue not already listed.;;;
Contribution Type;Empirical;"""New findings based on systematically observed data (quantitative, qualitative or mixed). Empirical studies on HCI provide new data, to reveal formerly unknown insights about human behavior and its relationship to technology.""";;;
;Artifact;"""Artifacts, often prototypes, include new systems, architectures, tools, toolkits, techniques, sketches, mockups, and envisionments that reveal new possibilities, enable new explorations, facilitate new insights, or compel us to consider new possible futures.""";;;
;Methodological;"""Add or refine the methods by which researchers or practitioners carry out their work in HCI. Research methods enable scientists to make new discoveries, while practitioner methods enable designers and developers to apply their craft to greater effect.""";;;
;Theoretical;"""New models, principles, concepts, or frameworks, or important variations on those that already exist.""";;;
;Dataset;"""New and useful corpus, often accompanied by an analysis of its characteristics, for the benefit of the research community. Datasets enable evaluations against shared benchmarks by new algorithms or systems.""";;;
;Literature Review;"""Review and synthesize work done in a research field with the goal of exposing trends, themes, and gaps in the literature.""";;;
;Opinion;"""Opinion research contributions, also called essays or arguments, seek to change the minds of readers through persuasion. (...) Along with persuasion, the goal of opinion contributions is to compel reflection, discussion, and debate.""";;;
Research Method;Controlled experiment;A controlled experiment with multiple comparative conditions in a controlled environment manipulated by the researcher.;;;
;Survey;“Well-defined and well-written set of questions to which an individual is asked to respond. Surveys are typically self-administered by an individual, with no researcher present”. The terms “survey” or “questionnaire” were explicitly used and it is not the same as a literature survey or survey contribution.;;;
;Usability testing;"""Representative users attempting representative tasks in representative environments, on early prototypes or working versions of computer interfaces. The world of usability testing includes: testing prototypes that have only been built on paper; testing screen mock-ups or wireframes which have no functionality; testing screen layouts which have partial functionality; testing prototypes that look complete but have a human behind the scenes responding (known as the “Wizard of Oz” technique); testing working versions of software before it is officially released; testing software that has already been implemented in existing systems"".";;;
;Interviews;Interviews with individuals.;;;
;Case study;Applied only if the authors used the term “case study”. Note that, there is some misunderstanding in the literature about the concept of case study where, often, authors mistake it for a scenario, use case, or test organization, since a “real” case study means that the case was carefully selected.;;;
;Focus groups;Holding a discussion with a group of participants who are stakeholders in the study.;;;
;Field study;Deployment of a tool and/or data collection in the wild (e.g., not lab).;;;
;Workshop/design;Some form of workshop or design session, or where researchers and participants worked collaboratively together (e.g., participatory design).;;;
;Other;For methods that did not fit into any of the above categories.;;;# PARTICIPANTS
Participant Groups;Not Applicable;No user study, and therefore no participants recruited.;;;
;Professionals with disabilities;Participants included people with disabilities.;;;
;Professionals without disabilities;Members of the general population, not specifically described as having disabilities. Note if the authors recruited a specific subpopulation other than those other categories here, record it as “other” (e.g., if they recruited people with financial expertise).;;;
;Organizations;Representants answering as the Company/Enterprise/Organization’s official manifestation.;;;
;Support staff;People whose responsibility it is to help PwD participate in carrying out their professional activities in software development teams. (e.g., people fluent in sign language).;;;
;Other;For participant groups that did not fit into any of the above categories.;;;
Workplace;Not Meaningful;This information is not mentioned in the study or it is not meaningful to the results or problem investigated.;;;
;Co-located;The study considers the development team working together on the same site.;;;
;Hybrid;Part of the development team works co-located and part remotely.;;;
;Full remote;All the development team works remotely.;;;
;Other;For workplaces that did not fit into any of the above categories.;;;
Role on the development team;Programmer;People who act as a software programmer, creating code artifacts on development teams.;;;
;Tester;People responsible for testing a software product during the development lifecycle.;;;
;Manager or Facilitator;People who're responsible to manage the efforts needed to deliver a software product. Usually reported as Project Manager, Scrum Master or Agilist.;;;
;Product Specialist;Product Owner, Product Manager, Requirements or Business Analyst.;;;
;Designer;User Experience Designer (UX), Product Designer, User Interface Designer (UI).;;;
;Not Specified;Not specified in the study.;;;
;Other;Other roles not mentioned.;;;
"The paper mentions the participation of PwD as Co-Author of the research""";Not Mentioned;Not specified in the study if among the authors there is a PwD.;;;
;Yes;The paper explicitly indicates the participation of a PwD as co-author.;;;
;No;The paper explicitly indicates that there isn’t a PwD as co-author.;;;
