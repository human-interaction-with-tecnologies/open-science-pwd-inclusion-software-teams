A409,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"Another challenge mentioned by blind developers is using debugging tools, as most debugging tools do not work well with screen readers"
A409,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Time consuming,Navigability,"Blind developers found it difficult to search through the code to find variables or methods, especially since it requires moving the cursor to a specific line in order to have the screen reader read it aloud"
A312,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,Navigability,"Blind programmers who are using screen readers or braille displays (which convey information linearly, one line at a time) have difficulty understanding structural relationships quickly [11, 19, 23]."
A279,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,Discoverability,"However, these cues are not always accessible to screen reader users, meaning that individuals who are blind may not be benefiting from the support provided to sighted users."
A61,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,Glanceability,"Many cues about the structure of source code like indentation and nesting hierarchies are encoded visually, making it difficult for DWVI to comprehend and navigate code with screen readers efficiently"
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,Many issues that blind screen reader users face when using web content stem from a lack of screen reader-compatible semantic structure and interactivity.
A241,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Cognitive Overload,Glanceability,"Other participants (P6, P10, P11) indicated the advantage of sighted programmers of moving through the code quicker and having less information to memorize than BVI programmers."
A305,Motor/physical impairment,Assistive Technology related,Time consuming,,"Participants also emphasized that any new approaches developed using solely voice as the primary method of interaction should be simple and intuitive “out-of-the-box”, as opposed to requiring additional configuration (which can potentially be tedious and time consuming)"
A241,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Time consuming,Navigability,Participants brought up the difficulty in navigating through a code base as their screen readers move primarily in a linear manner
A279,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Time consuming,,"Participants described the process of verifying code and content as time-consuming, as they would need to switch continuously between the code in the text editor to the browser page to ensure that all errors had been fixed. If further errors were identified, participants would often leave comments in the code to repair them at a later point in time."
A279,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"Participants highlighted difficulties with screen readers interpreting Javascript output, making it challenging in certain instances to verify whether the scripting code which they had written was appropriate. As a result, scripting languages were often used with caution."
A312,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,Discoverability,"Prior research on blind programmers has found that the information conveyed through visual metaphors in IDEs are often not conveyed by screen readers [2], which creates challenges for blind programmers [9, 18], putting them at a disadvantage when compared to their sighted peers [7, 11]"
A409,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"Screen readers only allow blind programmers to have access to a single line of code at a time. Therefore, to move around in the code, the programmers are limited to a few options: using the arrow keys to go through each line of code, using the outline or package explorer to navigate to a specific method and then navigating within the method line by line, or using a search mechanism"
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"Some participants (n=3) use the NVDA developer toolkit (DTK) [19] to better understand visual interfaces and the output of their CSS. NVDA DTK allows users to move through elements in the DOM using arrow keys and provides some information about the visual interface (such as their color, font, height, position of top, right, bottom, and left edges, and distance between parent elements). However, “DTK cannot access information such as CSS rules, padding, borders, or z-index” [58]"
A61,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"Sometimes CLI commands do provide progress indication. In these cases, they try to simulate GUI-like progress indication mechanisms like progress bars (Fig.5) and spinners (Fig.6). However, screen readers do not recognize them as progress indicators and vocalize the underlying Unicode characters"

A379,Other - Deaf-Blind,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,The interoperability of collaborative workplace systems with assistive technologies for deaf-blind users is limited to screen readers used with refreshable braille displays
A279,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"the restrictive nature of screen readers can impact the process of spatially-distributing content on a graphical user interface (e.g. a web page), resulting in designs which may not look as visually-appealing as those developed by sighted developers"
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Time consuming,,"The scarcity of documentation on accessibility of UI components meant that programmers with visual impairments often had to just “dive in and try” (T8) to assess the severity of issues across frameworks and libraries: P14: I produced a Qt 5 interface that I cannot interact with [...] after a long, long time of research, I learned about some basic things that can adjust the code to make it accessible to the screen reader."
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Time consuming,Navigability,"They also felt that the additional lines of code made readability and navigation difficult with screen readers, especially when editing the UI"
A8,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Cognitive Overload,,"This line-by-line strategy is feasible, but imposes a high cognitive load on the programmer—syntax details such as whitespace and block braces are often very difficult to follow, as Stefik et al. demonstrate in multiple studies [8],[9], [10]"
A74,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,Glanceability,"Unfortunately, screen readers do not have access to a program’s structure. Tokens are read one at-a-time, and the program is broken up into nothing more than a series of lines"

A100,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"Visually-impaired programmers today achieve this using screen readers and tactile displays, but these tools did not completely remove barriers to making professional computing truly accessible [4]."
A61,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"While being a text- and keyboard-based interface contributes to improved accessibility compared to graphical user interfaces, this does not necessarily translate into a completely accessible user experience. For instance, being text-based and keyboard operable would meet only a small subset of the WCAG [5] criteria"
A114,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Assistive Technology related,Technologically Limited,,"Unfortunately, blind programmers have no way to skim code that is presented on the web. The accessibility is comparable to that of a primitive text editor."
A533,General,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of inclusion policies,,(2) a lack of accountability towards disabled workers in atypical employment
A533,General,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of inclusion policies,,"A major difference between the Analogue and the Digital Economies lies in the invisibility of the online world: what happens in the virtual workplace may easily be left unseen, which makes it all the more important to collect data on disabilities within the Digital Economy, if inclusion is to be taken seriously and any labour market inequalities are to be addressed, as the European Union has set out to do."
A543,Neurodivergent,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of inclusion policies,,"Another point that was raised is that even with many actions being taken to make the company more pleasant for everyone, there are still groups that are not receiving due attention in some companies. A contrasting example given by the interviewees P4 and P7 is about the group of neurodivergent people. While P4 says the debate on neurodiversity does not happen within company A and the leadership is not trained to deal with these situations,"
A543,Neurodivergent,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Inadequate Hiring Process,diversity,"As reported by P4, these [selection] processes need to be restructured since the traditional ones used by companies usually depend on body language and other factors that naturally end up harming the performance of neurodivergent people."

A533,General,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of inclusion policies,,"For the distribution platforms to become more inclusive for all developers, a more responsive and approachable customer service would be required assisting disabled developers in the app review process."
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of inclusion policies,,"Furthermore, workplace dynamics complicated the implementation of accessibility. P10 mentioned that the changes had to be approved by senior management, who may consider the trade-offs between his productivity as a developer and the time it would take to improve the accessibility"
A520,Neurodivergent,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Inadequate Hiring Process,,"However, adults with ASD often have trouble navigating traditional job interviews, complex work environments due to the social dynamics, varied communication requirements and need for flexibility [28]."
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Impacts on Career Advancement,,"However, there has been little formal investigation of what navigating web development education and web-related career pathways are like as a blind screen reader user."
A305,Motor/physical impairment,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of Accessible Work Environments,,"However, this can present signifcant barriers for people with physical impairments who may experience challenges in using traditional input devices to support coding activities. The use of voice control in conjunction with other input modalities (e.g. mechanical switches, eye gaze, etc.) presents an alternative interaction method for enabling disabled developers to write, navigate, and manipulate code [6, 29, 32], although there has been a lack of work around this area to date"
A379,Other - Deaf-Blind,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of Accessible Work Environments,,"If anything is moved around or modified, there is a high probability that the user’s workflow could becompletely halted. The physical arrangement of the facility for the average employee, encourages a productive workflow. However, for the assistive technology user, the updating of furniture placement brings about anxiety and more effort to get used to adjustments and rework his daily routine."
A520,Neurodivergent,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Inadequate Hiring Process,,Individuals with ASD may be overlooked within a regular interview process due to their unique social skills.
A241,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Impacts on Career Advancement,,Participants mentioned often leaving the UI work to their coworkers while they focus on the logic aspect of the program.
A543,General,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of inclusion policies,General,"People with disabilities was only briefly mentioned by manager A. Some specific practices were still carried out, such as the addition of sign language interpreters in meetings, but which in any case only reach a small audience within the group of people with disabilities."
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Impacts on Career Advancement,,"Several participants (P2, P4, P7, P8, P11) told us that they have mostly shied away from front-end web development and in their professional lives have gravitated to companies/organizations that structure work around a division of labor between front-end and back-end web development"
A543,Neurodivergent,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of inclusion policies,General,"some groups end up being left out and little is done regarding their needs within companies. This is the scenario for neurodivergent people and people with disabilities, who even in the Software Engineering literature rarely have their needs discussed in the context of diversity"
A279,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Impacts on Career Advancement,,"They suggested that after trying to learn these technologies, frustrations from not being able to access components in the software led them to using alternative solutions."
A520,Neurodivergent,Companies inability to deal with PwD,Lack of Accessible Work Environments,,"When designing a typical office space, it is designed to meet all of the average persons’ basic needs. Although a lot of the time, the designer does not consider the needs of a person with ASD. Design elements that are autism-friendly include an orderly workspace, simple design, indirect lighting, muted colour tones, quietness and escape rooms which can create a positive work environment and help limit the stress and anxiety triggers for individuals with ASD [19, 34]"
A147,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,Discoverability,"Behind this problem are intertwined issues of accessibility and learnability. Because different IDEs use different architectures and have different levels of accessibility compliance, blind developers face a new learning curve each time they use an IDE"
A147,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,Blind developers also face the additional challenge of learning the non-visual workaround of accessing an IDE with a screen reader [9]
A241,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,"P6 mentioned the challenge when a new tool is introduced and the additional cognitive effort required by BVI programmers to learn it. Compared to sighted programmers, it may take longer for BVI programmers to learn a tool:"
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,"Six participants {P1, P3, P4, P7, P8, P10}, identified specific accessibility issues in official documentation"
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,"Six participants {P4, P5, P6, P9, P10} remarked upon the accessibility of forums and, in particular, Stack Over Flow"
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,"So, while textbooks were especially useful resources, whether they were accessible largely depended on their format"
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,"specific accessibility issues in blogs and tutorials. Most commonly, participants indicated that blogs and tutorials make heavy use of visual instructional content that is not properly described {P1, P2, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P12}. {P5} suggested that accessibility issues are especially prevalent in blogs and tutorials"
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,"The scarcity of documentation on accessibility of UI components meant that programmers with visual impairments often had to just “dive in and try” (T8) to assess the severity of issues across frameworks and libraries: P14: I produced a Qt 5 interface that I cannot interact with [...] after a long, long time of research, I learned about some basic things that can adjust the code to make it accessible to the screen reader."
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,These challenges are amplified by IDE documentation that rely on screenshots and do not list relevant keyboard shortcuts
A114,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,"Blogs and tutorials routinely feature code samples embedded alongside the text. If a blind programmer wants to skim the code, they must have an IDE that supports it. They must then clone the entire repository or manually download single files. This process is tedious and will reduce the blind programmer’s effectiveness at a program comprehension task."
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Educational Resources and Learning,,,"while web search sites were largely accessible, the variable accessibility of returned results created an mixed experience. Additionally, because the web search sites return valid results—their intended function—inaccessibility in the sources returned may be particularly frustrating, in that DWVI, like {P11}, may know they have found the right information, but are then prevented from retrieving it."
A8,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Unemployment,,,"blind programmers were a target of deliberate discrimination by employers, despite legal protections, due to confusion about how a blind person might integrate into team of sighted programmers [19]. Studies of how blind programmers comprehend code may help demystify the process of hiring the visually impaired"
A520,Neurodivergent,Unemployment,,,"individuals with ASD in their twenties were found to be less likely to be employed than their peers with other disabilities, including speech/ language impairment, emotional disturbance, intellectual disability and learning disabilities"
A520,Neurodivergent,Unemployment,,,"Strikingly, almost 42% of young adults on the autism spectrum either never worked, or worked and did not receive remuneration for that work during their early 20’s"
A533,General,Unemployment,,,"The Committee also noted the persistent employment and pay gaps, which reveal the severity of the labour market inequalities. The employment gap between disabled and nondisabled people of working age is currently at 20 and 40 percentage points for the EU and the UK respectively."
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Fear of being judged unqualified,,"But, our findings suggest that whether employing the vision of sighted colleagues as a workaround was perceived by DWVI as an embarrassing act of reliance or a typical team collaboration depended upon the knowledge and empathy of their sighted teammate"
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Fear of being judged unqualified,,"These instances highlight that accessibility issues in UI development could affect responsibilities beyond software engineering tasks, which developers are expected to perform in professional settings."
A312,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Fear of being judged unqualified,,"Our participants indicated that seeking help from others, especially from those who are sighted, is avoided by many blind individuals in workplace settings, often due to embarrassment about the amount of time they take to accomplish certain tasks."
A463,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Fear of being judged unqualified,,"However, programmers with visual impairments feel that seeking assistance draws attention to the additional time it takes them to complete programming tasks [5]. This is likely to be magnifed in collaborative contexts, which we examine in our study"
A379,Other - Deaf-Blind,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Social Interaction Challenges,,"At the moment, adding a short sentence like “Hope you’re having a good day!” to the beginning of an email takes substantially longer for the user than it does for the average person. Consequently, the user avoids adding in such phrases and sticks to writing emails that are succinct and direct, so they can come off as unwelcoming and standoffish."
A464,Neurodivergent,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Social Interaction Challenges,,Challenges in social interactions and asking for help were identified.
A520,Neurodivergent,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Social Interaction Challenges,,"However, adults with ASD often have trouble navigating traditional job interviews, complex work environments due to the social dynamics, varied communication requirements and need for flexibility [28]."
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Fear of being judged unqualified,,P16 shared that his position as the only blind person in the organization and as a new member of the team foregrounded his request. Insisting upon accessibility could suggest to the team that he was not able to do his job as well as other developers.
A379,Other - Deaf-Blind,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Social Interaction Challenges,,"Since he is blind-deaf, it is difficult for people to interact with him face-to-face, as any contact startles him."
A464,Neurodivergent,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Social Interaction Challenges,,"Neurodiverse individuals offer unique perspectives and strengths to the workplace. However, they may encounter challenges related to executive functions (e.g., inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, working memory, planning, and reasoning), essential for behavioral control, teamwork, and job performance in software development"
A520,Neurodivergent,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Social Interaction Challenges,,"This lack of interpersonal skills can in turn be a challenge to those with ASD trying to gain employment as a significant number of software development jobs require communication, collaboration and management skills [16]"
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Fear of being judged unqualified,,"Participants (n = 3) shared that poor accessibility of the UI presented challenges during demonstrations. In meetings involving stakeholders and clients, it could also suggest poor quality of work by the team."
A520,Neurodivergent,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Social Interaction Challenges,,"Individuals may experience difficulty empathising with colleagues and as many autistic people have restricted or specialised interests, they may distract themselves during social interactions [17] making it difficult to build relationships among co-workers and peers. Morris et al. explain that individuals with autism experience difficulties interpreting co-workers’ statements and emotions, coping with office politics and managing conflicts with peers [16]. These various social challenges can in turn induce stress and anxiety for those experiencing ASD, especially in the workplace"
A379,Other - Deaf-Blind,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Social Interaction Challenges,,"The need for such a device was imperative as we heard through our contextual inquiry that some have concerns on what to do in the times of an emergency and others feel anxious initiating an in-person conversation with the user. Trying to address this issue, this system hopes to alleviate some of the concerns and anxiety that revolve around such interactions."
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Extra work advocating for accessibility,,"Participants also described having to advocate for accessible solutions within their team. Often the decision to use a particular framework or programming tool was taken by the team collectively. If they chose things with poor accessibility, it could severely impact the productivity of programmers with visual impairments. For instance, P8 had to convince his team to use Xamarin and Visual Studio for the Android application they were building; the poor accessibility of Android Studio would keep him from giving his “full efforts”: P8: I explained to them that if we develop using Xamarin, we will be able to do it in less time."
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Extra work advocating for accessibility,,"P8 told us about a number of strategies employed to self-advocate in the workplace, but ultimately that it was the responsibility of everyone"
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Extra work advocating for accessibility,,"As prior work has found, programmers with visual impairments were often tasked with educating their colleagues about accessibility issues and advocating for accessible solutions"
A79,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Extra work advocating for accessibility,,P8 described issues with colleagues not knowing how to work with him and needing to demonstrate how
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Extra work advocating for accessibility,,"Both P10 and P16 shared that they had pushed for making their UIs accessible, not only to make themselves more productive but also for other screen reader users. However, it was difficult to implement accessibility in legacy UIs, an issue also raised in several email threads (n = 5)."
A146,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,Remote,That task of providing accessible awareness information lies at the heart of facilitating effective remote collaborations in mixedability contexts.
A146,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,Remote,"In summary, the workarounds discussed above insufficiently convey collaborator awareness, suffer from delays, place a disproportionate burden on BVI people for driving the collaboration, and compromise their agency"
A146,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,,"A common approach is asking collaborators to describe their actions, but sighted people often forget to verbalize the relevant details, resulting in incomplete collaborator awareness"
A146,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,Remote,"This screen inaccessibility is magnifed in remote synchronous collaboration. (...). However, BVI developers cannot access the screen share video or the visual awareness cues in IDEs through assistive technologies such as screen readers"

A520,Neurodivergent,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,,People with ASD can also struggle with multitasking which may be particularly difficult during team meetings where employees must listen and contribute to the conversation
A579,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,On-Site,"In the beginning, the blind developer was limited to performing accessibility tests and maintaining old software. He was unable to access information displayed on visual management items, and consequently was unable to communicate with his colleges through these means."
A579,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,On-Site,"This version of the Task Board had accessibility problems. In fact, nothing in it was accessible. The features copied and placed on one of the twelve frames made it virtually impossible for a blind person to find information on the task board"
A579,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,On-Site,"The Task Board contained four projects, and someone had to guide him to the correct one. Furthermore, to distinguish the stages of the project, he had to find the end of the table containing the project he was assigned, and then with his finger find the boundaries between each stage until the To Do column."
A579,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,On-Site,"The new process included several visual management elements, such as task board [13], work completion graphs [14, 5], and software testing panels [15]. These components helped provide transparency, inspection capacity and schedule predictability. However, the team included one blind developer, so a model based on visual elements meant a challenge for them."
A65,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,Work Dynamics in mixed ability teams,Collaborative Work Challenges,,"If the UI elements are not in the correct order or misrepresented, then it affects screen reader navigation and interaction.
